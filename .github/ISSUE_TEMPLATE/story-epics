By convention, this community uses Epics (zenhub epics) as two things: 
1. Containers/topics (usually a set of  nouns) that can nest inside each other;
2. User Stories that are contained under a set of topics.

A user story should have the form: 

As a Persona X, I need Y, so that Z. Example: "As a CISO at a F100 company, I need a B2B integration bus that has an SLA of 9.99999 uptime, so that I can hold someone accountable for service failures."

(The "so that" clause is essential, because it sets the context in a way that gives engineering teams latitude to solve the problem in a variety of ways, not just the prescription in the "I need a" clause.)
