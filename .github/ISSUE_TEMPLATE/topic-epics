Description usually as series of nouns (if action verbs in header, consider whether this is better as an issue/task).

Don't forget to convert issue to Epic (and use Zenhub to manage).

You can embed these Epics inside other Epics. Terminate ideally in a set of User Stories...which ideally connect to Issues as Engineering tasks or to-dos.
