# How to contribute?

__Baseline__ is an open-source project that is actively seeking contributions from any willing participants. Here are some guidelines for people that would like to contribute to the project.

## Submitting an issue

To help us get a better understanding of the issue you've identified, follow the guidelines in one of our *Issue Templates*.

## Submitting a pull request

Follow these steps when submitting a pull request:

1. Fork this repo into your GitHub account. Read more about forking a repo on Github [here](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).
1. Create a new branch, based on the `master` branch, with a name that concisely describes what you’re working on (ex. `add-mysql`).
1. Ensure that your changes do not cause any existing tests to fail.
1. Submit a pull request against the `master` branch.

## Signing the eCLA/iCLA

Anyone can do a pull request and commit. In order for your work to be merged, you will need to sign the eCLA (entity contributor agreement) if you are contributing on behalf of your company, or iCLA (individual contributor agreement) if you are just contributing for yourself. [Learn more about the eCLA here.](https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/projects/cla/projects-entity-cla)

The iCLA is administered by a bot which will comment on your PR and direct you to sign the iCLA if you haven’t previously done so. This happens automatically when people submit a pull request, or they can access directly by going to [https://cla-assistant.io/ethereum-oasis/baseline](https://cla-assistant.io/ethereum-oasis/baseline)
