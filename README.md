Lost supplies, fraudulent medicine, and supply chain confusion; in times like this, we understand medical equipment is a public resource, akin to the water we drink, the air we breathe, and the levels of freedom we should enjoy as a human right. To that end, visibility must be pervasive throughout the medical supply chain in order to better serve the public. 

In developed countries, a complex medical infrastructure, while not perfect, props up medical providers that can be identified and trusted by consumers. In 3rd world countries, this is not the case - there is no clear way for consumers to identify whether vaccines and the providers they receive them from are worthy of being trusted.

The widespread nature of the COVID-19 crisis means billions may have to be vaccinated. The days of being assured of vaccine safety because a UN or WHO representative in a white doctorâ€™s coat is administering such a vaccine is over. Wide-spread vaccine distribution and administration need the support of a wide-spread, easy-to-understand, highly transparent supply chain beneficial to researchers, manufacturers, distributors, and consumers. That is __GMedChain__.

# The platform

We've built a platform based on the [__Baseline Protocol__](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis/baseline), a joint project between Consensys, Microsoft and EY. 

The __GMedChain platform__ code is currently embedded inside the `/radish-api` directory. This name, Radish, came from the initial name of the Baseline protocol PoC, but we will rename it later. You don't need to deep dive into this directory if you just want to deploy the platform: a __Makefile__ is available, described in the section right above.

## Quickstart

A `Makefile` has been included for convenience; most of its targets wrap `npm`, `docker` and `solc` invocations.

Just want to get the __GMedChain platform__ running locally? The following sequence will build the monorepo, start the __GMedChain platform__ stack locally, deploy contracts and run the full test suite. *Note: this typically takes at least 20 minutes to complete.

```
make && make start && make test
```

### The demo UI

After running the above (`make test` optional) you can view the Radish34 demo by opening [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

Here are the targets currently exposed by the `Makefile`:

| Target | Description |
|:-------------|:------------------------------------------------------------|
| `make` | Alias for `make build`. |
| `make build` | Build all modules within the monorepo. |
| `make build-containers` | Dockerize all modules within the monorepo. |
| `make clean` | Reclaim disk used by all modules (i.e. `node_modules/`) and the local docker environment. This effectively uninstalls your local __GMedChain platform__ environment and will require building from scratch. |
| `make contracts` | Compile the Solidity contracts. |
| `make deploy-contracts` | Deploy the Solidity contracts. Requires the stack to be running. |
| `make npm-install` | `npm i` wrapper for all modules in the monorepo. |
| `make start` | Start the full __GMedChain platform__ stack. Requires `docker` service to be running with at least 12 GB RAM allocation. |
| `make stop` | Stop the running __GMedChain platform__ stack. |
| `make system-check` | Verify that `docker` is configured properly. |
| `make restart` | Stop and start the `docker` stack. |
| `make reset` | Clean the docker environment by pruning the docker networks and volumes. |
| `make test` | Run the full test suite. Requires the stack to be running. |
| `make zk-circuits` | Perform zk-SNARK trusted setups for circuits contained within `zkp/circuits` |

## Running the GMedChain platform

To run the __GMedChain platform__ application, follow the instructions in [radish34/README.md](radish34/README.md).

`cd radish34` and go from there ðŸš€

# What is here?

The root directory of this repo (where this Readme currently lives) contains the following folders:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ baseline  <-- Future home to the Baseline Protocol libraries
â”œâ”€â”€ bin <-- Scripts to run across the entire project
â”œâ”€â”€ docs <-- auto-generated and artisanal hand crafted documentation 
â””â”€â”€ radish34 <-- The demonstration POC (you probably are looking for this)
```

## Running scripts across the project

To use the top level scripts (currently just documentation auto-generation and collection) do the following: 

Required: NodeJS 11.15 (nvm is recommended)

 - run `make npm-install` to install the top level packages

optionally `make clean` to clean out any `node_modules` folders installed by the `make npm-install` command.
