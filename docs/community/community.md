# Open Source Community

The Baseline Protocol initiative was [announced](https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/ey-and-consensys-announce-formation-of-baseline-protocol-initiative-to-make-ethereum-mainnet-safe-and-effective-for-enterprises/) on March 4, 2020 and launched as an [OASIS](https://oasis-open-projects.org/) open source project on March 19, 2020, supported by fourteen founding companies. The initiative is strongly aligned with the Mainnet Working Group, a joint effort of the [Enterprise Ethereum Alliance](https://entethalliance.org) and the [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.org).

> This work is active and open to contributors.

All work in the [Baseline Protocol public repo](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis/baseline) is released under the CC0 1.0 Universal public domain dedication. For the full license text, refer to [`license.md`](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis/baseline/blob/master/license.md).

## **Leadership**

In an openly governed open standards / open source initiative, leadership is organic. One need not be seated to a committee to lead. One need not be the chair to lead the community in a direction. \(Indeed, the chair's primary job is to harmonize the interests of others and help the community move to a shared vision, not necessarily to forward their own point of view.\)  

> **The way to lead is to start something, help something, fix something...even spellcheck something!  The way to lead is to get others to amplify what you are doing \(best done by listening deeply to others first\). The way to lead is to serve your own \(and your company's\) enlightened self interest. You should be able to draw a straight line from your time on this work to real impact for your own offerings.**

Below are the things you need to know to get informed, get involved and get value out of the work.

## Working Together

### Meetings and Meetups

Check the [**group calendar**](https://lists.oasis-open-projects.org/g/baseline/calendar) for times/dates of online \(and eventually face to face\) meetings. If the times we have don't work for your timezone, we can do 1-1's or make changes to the schedule. Chime in on the [**Slack**](https://communityinviter.com/apps/ethereum-baseline/join-us)...don't be shy.

#### Onboarding: Help Getting Started

It's critical that new contributors have a good idea about what the focal points of the community are and where one can make a real impact. Hard to beat having a real conversation about how to get started in an intimate setting where you can ask questions and get immediate answers. ****

We will hold Onboarding office hours twice a week at least until June 2020. Sign up, or reach out on Slack to ask for 1-1 time. 

#### **Roadmapping**

There will be sessions \(online for now during the period of global pandemic\) to dive deep on the technology. Check the [calendar](https://lists.oasis-open-projects.org/g/baseline/calendar) for details. 

#### Technical Steering Committee

The [TSC](community-members.md#your-technical-steering-committee) will meet typically once a month, biweekly during the early direction setting period from March to June of 2020. Members of the TSC can check the TSC [sub-group calendar](https://lists.oasis-open-projects.org/g/baseline-tsc/calendar) and receive invitations.

#### Specifications Steering Committee

The [SSC](community-members.md#your-specifications-steering-committee) will meet typically once a month, biweekly during the early direction setting period from March to June of 2020. Members of the SSC can check the SSC [sub-group calendar](https://lists.oasis-open-projects.org/g/baseline/subgroups) and receive invitations.

### Connecting with Each Other Directly

#### Slack

The Baseline Protocol initiative maintains a Slack channel that is moderated but public. Sign up [**here**](https://communityinviter.com/apps/ethereum-baseline/join-us).  It's an active group, and you can directly connect with folks doing the work and coordinate with each other to get the work done.

#### Members Directory

You can [**sign up**](https://lists.oasis-open-projects.org/g/baseline) to the baseline protocol members list and get access to the [**Directory**](https://lists.oasis-open-projects.org/g/baseline/directory). This will show you any members who have elected to be displayed publicly. There are others who will choose to be hidden but will receive group emails.

#### Group Email

When you [sign up](https://lists.oasis-open-projects.org/g/baseline) in the members directory, you will have the option to get email that's sent to the mailing list or directly from anyone in the group. You can control how that impacts your inbox [**here**](https://lists.oasis-open-projects.org/g/baseline/editsub). 

#### Forums

The team hasn't yet set up a Reddit or other public forum, but several new members are already talking about doing that. Stay tuned or help make it happen.

#### Social Networking

The Baseline Protocol initiative maintains the [@baselineproto](https://twitter.com/baselineproto) Twitter account, to which members of the TSC, SSC and some maintainers can post. We also use the [\#baselineprotoco](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Baselineprotocol)l tag.

#### Medium

The Baseline Protocol initiative will use Medium to post blogs. Here is the [**publication**](https://medium.com/baselineprotocol).  Reach out on Slack to the chair, OASIS team or members of the steering committees, if you want to be a writer or editor.
