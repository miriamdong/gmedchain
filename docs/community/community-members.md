These are senior industry executives and influencers who can rally support for the work and help find ways to structure incentives for people to focus on key Epics and Stories in the [repo](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis/baseline). \(Note, epics and stories maintained in [Zenhub](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis/baseline#workspaces/baseline-5e713dc4f555144d9d6d17f6/board?repos=239590893).

SSC members are seated by consensus of the sitting members. There is no specific maximum number of seats, and it is expected that the members will form sub-committees for topics like industry verticals.
