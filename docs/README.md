# Welcome

## Welcome to the Baseline Protocol Community

The Baseline Protocol initiative was [announced](https://consensys.net/blog/press-release/ey-and-consensys-announce-formation-of-baseline-protocol-initiative-to-make-ethereum-mainnet-safe-and-effective-for-enterprises/) on March 4, 2020 and launched as an [OASIS](https://oasis-open-projects.org/) open source project on March 19, 2020, supported by fourteen founding companies. More companies joined the effort shortly thereafter and continue to do so. Here's a [full list](community/community-members.md) of contributors.

The work of the community is maintained under a public domain license at  
[**https://github.com/ethereum-oasis/baseline**](https://github.com/ethereum-oasis/baseline).

You will find in the Repo the code of a procurement demo called **Radish34**. And separately, there is a folder that will contain the specifications, reference code and other material constituting the **Baseline Protocol**, as the community derives it from the initial Radish34 proof of concept.

There are lots of opportunities to get informed, get involved, and **get value** out of defining requirements, developing reusable components, and ultimately deploying the Baseline Protocol in your own offerings.

**New Contributors:  Go** [**here**](community/community.md) **for details on how to get involved.**

## The Baseline Protocol

The Baseline Protocol is an approach to using the public [Mainnet](basics/glossary.md#mainnet) as a common frame of reference between systems, including traditional corporate systems of record, any kind of database or state machine, and even different blockchains or DLTs. It is particularly promising as a way to reduce capital expense and other overheads while increasing operational integrity when automating business processes across multiple companies.

The approach is designed to appeal to security and performance-minded technology officers.

You can find all the details on the Baseline Protocol [here](baseline-protocol/protocol.md).

## The Radish34 Demo

In 2019, three members of the Baseline Protocol community, EY, ConsenSys and Microsoft, got together to build a proof of concept showing how enterprises could safely and effectively use the public Ethereum network to conduct end-to-end supply chain operations without compromising corporate information security norms and practices. What the team learned from that effort led to the formation of the Baseline Protocol initiative.
