  Describe the key things the baseline community needs to see improved,
  supported, created in order to grow as a protocol, so that enterprises will
  use the approach and get used to the Mainnet.

# Driving Mainnet Evolution

The Mainnet is a \[ insert copy from the upcoming Medium article \]. 

## Point to Point Messaging

The Radish34 demo uses Whisper, which comes with standard Geth nodes, to 

## Zokrates Support or Replacement

While the baseline approach isn't solely about zero knowledge techniques, it uses them to ensure that all parties store the same data in their respective systems of record, execute business rules consistently, and enforce the correctness of Workflow Steps. 

One aspect of this is Zokrates, a domain specific language \(DSL\) for taking logical functions and turning them into the "addition, subtraction, multiplication" math required by zero knowledge proofs. Zokrates is an open source project maintained by \[  \]. From the perspective of the enterprise, it has the disadvantage of being distributed under a \[  \] license, not Apache2 or MIT. 

For enterprises to adopt a DSL like Zokrates as part of their core IT stack, it needs to be GA'd, the problem of the license must be dealt with -- there are a number of ways to handle this -- and the project must be well supported at a level that can give enterprises confidence.

## Eth2

The Baseline Protocol can provide utility for a variety of uses across industries today on the current \[  \] Ethereum. It avoids several of the key issues enterprises have with using "public" Ethereum.

## Barriers to Enterprise Adoption of Public Blockchain

\[List the 10-12 issues and talk about how the baseline protocol was created to avoid most of them and bring the rest within the risk profile of traditional Internet-capable IT systems.\]
