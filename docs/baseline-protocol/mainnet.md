  Describe the key things the baseline community needs to see improved,
  supported, created in order to grow as a protocol, so that enterprises will
  use the approach and get used to the Mainnet.

## Zokrates Support or Replacement

While the baseline approach isn't solely about zero knowledge techniques, it uses them to ensure that all parties store the same data in their respective systems of record, execute business rules consistently, and enforce the correctness of Workflow Steps.

One aspect of this is Zokrates, a domain specific language \(DSL\) for taking logical functions and turning them into the "addition, subtraction, multiplication" math required by zero knowledge proofs. Zokrates is an open source project maintained released under the GNU Lesser General Public License v3. From the perspective of the enterprise, it could have a potential disadvantage of being distributed under an LGPL-3.0 license, not Apache2 or MIT.

For enterprises to adopt a new langauage framework like the native DSL in Zokrates as part of their core IT stack, it needs to be GA'd, the problem of the license must be dealt with -- there are a number of ways to handle this -- and the project must be well supported at a level that can give enterprises confidence.

## Eth2

The Baseline Protocol can provide utility for a variety of uses across industries today on the current Ethereum 1.x version(s). There are several existing hurdles (operational, information security, privacy, legal, regulatory) that enterprises have with using "public" Ethereum, in the larger scheme of adoption and standardization of the Baseline protocol. One of the key areas is the upgrade from Eth1 to Eth2 for the public mainnet in the upcoming months. There are several aspects of Eth2 to be considered, and Baseline protocol and the Radish34 implementation of some of these aspects seeks to address changes from a platform level in the transition.

Proposed improvements in Eth2 include efficient blockchain state transitions using more optimal polynomial commitment schemes for hashing and storing local blockchain state. The storage of such local state can be significantly reduced due to shifting from Merkle tree storage to stateless client model using polynomial commitments promises to reduce data computation needs increasing efficiency in data computations and management. This would have implications in the management of the Shield/Verifier contracts to change the way the state of business processes can be accumulated on chain.
