# Mainnet

A Mainnet in the context of the Baseline Protocol is an always-on public utility, a state machine that resists tampering and censorship but sacrifices speed, scalability and fast finality in order to allow anyone to help maintain the integrity of the database. Because the Mainnet is a permanent public record, encrypted information placed there can be observed by anyone at any time, forever. This includes parties with the means and know-how to perform advanced analytics and ascertain patterns that may reveal strategic intelligence even without having to defeat the encryption of the data itself. 

Used correctly, the Mainnet can be employed by business to solve long-standing problems: 

1. Automate B2B agreements without creating new silos \(like private blockchains do\)
2. Integrate new relationships with existing ones flexibly without losing system integrity or adding integrations on top of integrations
3. Enforce consistency between different partiesâ€™ records without having to move the data or business logic from legacy systems 
4. Enforce continuity in a multiparty workflow \(e.g., an invoice always agrees with the purchase order\) while compartmentalizing which parties know the details in each step

## Purpose

The purpose of this section is to define the long-run specifications for a Mainnet required by organizations conducting baselining. These specifications, both functional and non-functional, will be used to articulate requirements to bodies such as the Ethereum core development community. And should the Ethereum mainnet fail to deliver on the essential requirements in a timeframe that commercial outlook can contemplate, then this specification will be used to seek out an alternative. In the end, from the perspective of the Baseline Protocol, the important thing about the Mainnet is that it can become, like the Internet, a widely-used public good.  



This section is a work in progress. Stay tuned as the community bootstraps.
