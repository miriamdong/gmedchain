# UI Integration

In the Radish34 Demo, the team built a simple web-based UI to simulate the user experience of systems of record that were enabled with the Baseline Protocol. You can find that here:

In the real world, the user experience is the experience of any number of products.

If you are are in charge of the feature/benefit mix of a product in ERP, CRM, SCM, Core Banking or any other type of system of record, you can use the example in the Radish34 UI section to get ideas for how to integrate with baseline components \(whether they have added to your product's internal services or whether they have been deployed as services in your wider IT environment\) and present baselining benefits to users.
