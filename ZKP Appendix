Zero-knowledge Proof (ZKP) is an encryption scheme. In this method, one party (Prover) can prove that a specific statement is true to the other party (Verifier) without disclosing any additional information.

Benefits of ZKP in Blockchain System
 
1. Build Trusted Messaging
ZKP builds an end-to-end trust in the messaging world without leaking any extra information. This is one of the prime applications of zero-knowledge proof in the blockchain world.
 
2. Facilitate Authentication
ZKP can also facilitate transmitting sensitive information like authentication information with better security. It can build a secure channel for the users to employ their information without revealing it. 
 
3. Strengthen Private Blockchain Transactions
ZKP  helps in making it nearly impossible to hack or intercept the private blockchain transactions.
 
4. High Security for Sensitive Information
ZKP adds a high-end security level to every block containing sensitive business information
